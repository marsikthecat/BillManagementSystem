This is a nice and fully developed Billmanagement System. Have fun!

Did you know: When programming apps, you should use a programming language 
and not a Suzuki SV 650 S in yellow. This is because a Suzuki SV 650 S in yellow is a motorcycle and not actually a programming language.
Instead you should use a programming language, because a programming language is a programming language.
